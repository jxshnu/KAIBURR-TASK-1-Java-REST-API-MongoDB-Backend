# Kaiburr Assessment - Task 1: Java REST API & MongoDB Backend

This repository contains the complete, runnable source code for **Task 1 of the Kaiburr Technical Assessment**.  
The project is a **production-ready, secure Java Spring Boot application** that provides a RESTful API for managing “task” objects, with all data persisted in a **MongoDB** database.

The application is built not just to meet the requirements, but to **showcase best practices** in modern backend development — focusing on **security**, **maintainability**, and **clean architecture**.

## 🚀 Key Features & Professional Approach

### 🔒 Robust Security First
Security is the primary concern. The API includes a critical validation layer that:
- **Prevents Shell Injection:** Rejects commands containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&&`) to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Uses an Allow-list:** Only permits explicitly approved commands (`ping`, `nslookup`, etc.), preventing arbitrary code execution.

### 🏗️ Enterprise-Grade Architecture
Implements a **multi-layered architecture** (Controller → Service → Repository) for clean separation of concerns, ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability.

### ⚙️ Centralized Exception Handling
A global `@ControllerAdvice` handles all exceptions uniformly, returning clean API error responses instead of stack traces.

### 🌍 Seamless Environment Configuration
Uses **Spring Profiles** to handle multiple environments (local and Kubernetes) without any code changes.

## 💻 Live Demonstration of API Functionality

### 1. Create a New Task
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/health-checks"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{ "name": "Google Ping", "owner": "sriji", "command": "ping -c 4 google.com" }'
```

**Result Screenshot:**

### 2. Get a Task by ID
**Request:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/health-checks/<YOUR_ID_HERE>"
```

### 3. Demonstrate Security Validation
**Request:**
```bash
curl -v -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/api/health-checks"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{ "name": "Malicious Command", "owner": "hacker", "command": "echo hello; rm -rf /" }'
```

**Result Screenshot:**

### 4. Delete a Task
**Request:**
```bash
curl -v -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/health-checks/<YOUR_ID_HERE>"
```
